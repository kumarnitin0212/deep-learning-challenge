This project tried to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup Co. Alphabet Soup Co. wants to provide funding to companies but it needs to know in advance whether it will be successful or not. Money is on the line here and we would not want for it to go to waste.

For this I will create a neural network by using Data Manipulation, creating training and testing sets, and finally analyzing my models that I have created.

Results
Data Processing

To clean the data I removed the EIN and NAME columns since they have no value to the model.
The varibales being considered for my model are as follows: 'STATUS', 'ASK_AMT', 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'INCOME_AMT'. I dropped "USE_CASE_Other","AFFILIATION_Other" columns.
My Dependent varible is "IS_SUCCESFUL" since we want to try to predict this with high accuracy.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model Attempt #1

-2 Hidden Layers
-80 neurons (Layer1), 30 neurons(Layer2)
-Used Relu and Sigmoid Activations Functions since sigmoid is best for binary classifcation problems as this and relu is for nonlinear datasets.
-Removed "USE_CASE_Other","AFFILIATION_Other" columns.
215/215 - 1s - loss: 0.5844 - accuracy: 0.7286 - 684ms/epoch - 3ms/step
Loss:0.5844154357910156, Accuracy: 0.7285714149475098

Attempt #2

-3 Hidden Layers
-80 neurons (Layer1), 30 neurons(Layer2), 15 neurons(Layer3)
-Used Relu and Sigmoid Activations Functions since sigmoid is best for binary classifcation problems as this and relu is for nonlinear datasets.
-Removed "USE_CASE_Other","AFFILIATION_Other" columns.
215/215 - 1s - loss: 0.5793 - accuracy: 0.7292 - 663ms/epoch - 3ms/step
Loss:0.5793452262878418, Accuracy: 0.7291545271873474

Attempt #3

-3 Hidden Layers
-80 neurons(Layer1), 35 neurons(Layer2), 10 neurons (Layer3)
-Used Relu and Sigmoid Activations Functions since sigmoid is best for binary classifcation problems as this and relu is for nonlinear        datasets.
-Went back to original dataset

215/215 - 1s - loss: 0.5953 - accuracy: 0.7271 - 591ms/epoch - 3ms/step
Loss:0.5953055024147034, Accuracy: 0.7271137237548828


Attempt #4

-3 Hidden Layers
-80 neurons (Layer1), 30 neurons(Layer2), 15 neurons (Layer3)
-Reordered Relu and Sigmoid Activations
-Went back to original dataset
215/215 - 1s - loss: 0.5622 - accuracy: 0.7305 - 616ms/epoch - 3ms/step
Loss:0.5622333288192749, Accuracy: 0.7304664850234985


Summary
I tried to change my models in order to achieve a more than 75% accuracy rate but only got about 73%. I changed my features, activation functions, Hidden Layers, and the number of neurons in order to achieve this.On Average my models kept around 73% accuracy score which is decent considering it was an improvement.
